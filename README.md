# 3D Flower Meristem at stage 4
This repository serves the purpose to store a web-app (built with Dash, Plotly and Bootstrap in Python)  
that is deployed via Heroku on https://threed-flower-meristem.herokuapp.com.  

The web-app allows to view the predicted gene expression profiles of a selected set of 1,000 genes in a  
3D model of the developing (A. thaliana) flower meristem at stage 4.  
Next to that, also the UMAP clustering (from scRNA-seq data at stage 4) can be viewed in the 3D  
model (probabilistic mapping of single cells to cells in 3D model via novosparc).
